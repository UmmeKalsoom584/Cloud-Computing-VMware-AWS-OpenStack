# Cloud-Computing-VMware-AWS-OpenStack
🚀 **Project Description**

A hands-on project building a hybrid cloud environment. Deployed local VMs (CentOS, Windows, OpenStack) & configured AWS services (EC2, VPC, S3, EBS). Demonstrates end-to-end cloud infrastructure skills.

🔑 **Key Features**

🧪 **Hybrid Architecture:**

Bridged on-premise virtualization (VMware) with public cloud services (AWS).

🖥️ **Multi-OS Virtualization**:

Built & configured VMs running CentOS & Windows Vista, ensuring network connectivity (NAT) and host-guest communication.

⚡ **Private Cloud Deployment**: 

Deployed a full OpenStack cloud (via DevStack) on Ubuntu, creating a private IaaS platform.

🚀 **AWS Core Services Mastery:**


**EC2:** Launched instances, used User Data scripts to auto-deploy Apache web server.

**VPC**:  Built a custom virtual network with subnets, route tables, and an Internet Gateway.

**Security**:  Configured Security Groups with least-privilege access (SSH restricted to My IP).

**EBS**:  Created, attached, formatted, and mounted block storage volumes.

**S3**: Used AWS CLI to upload/download files to a secure object storage bucket.

📈 **Automation**: Automated setup tasks with bash scripting and AWS bootstrapping.

🐛 **Troubleshooting**: Resolved issues in networking, firewalls, permissions, and service configs.

📊 **Professional Reporting**: Documented the entire process with a detailed LaTeX report.

🛠️ **Technology Stack**

**Hypervisor**: 
VMware Workstation Pro

**OS**: CentOS, Windows Vista, Ubuntu Server

**Cloud**: OpenStack (DevStack), Amazon Web Services (AWS)

**AWS Services**: EC2, VPC, IAM, Security Groups, EBS, S3

**Tools**: AWS CLI, OpenStack CLI, Bash, PowerShell, LaTeX

🎯 **What This Demonstrates to Employers**

**Practical Cloud Skills**: Real, hands-on experience with leading cloud platforms.

**Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Mindset**: Automation of deployment and configuration.

**Security Awareness** Implementing least-privilege security principles.

**Problem-Solving Ability**: Capable of diagnosing and resolving technical issues.

**Attention to Documentation**: The ability to clearly document and present work.
